# 🌍 GeoGlimpse

**GeoGlimpse** is a simple and visually engaging web app that allows users to explore different countries through unique greetings, foods, festivals, fun facts, and more — all from a single search query. It's an educational and interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data sourced from a local JSON file.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic country pages generated via JavaScript
- Includes national flags, greetings, and rich cultural insights
- Food and festival highlights for each country
- Fun facts to keep the content lively and educational
- Responsive and minimal UI

## 📁 How It Works

1. The app reads a `search` parameter from the URL (e.g., `?search=nepal`).
2. It fetches data from a local `countries.json` file.
3. Dynamically renders each section: cover image, greeting, about, food, festivals, and fun facts.
